#diff_match_patch
a re-packaging of the javascript library by Neil Fraser for use in server side javascript

##Installation

    npm install diff_match_patch

##Usage
Just like the original library, you'll be using instances of the diff_match_patch class:
    dmpmod = require('diff_match_patch') 
    var dmp = new dmpmod.diff_match_patch();
    text1= "I'm some text";
    text2= "I'm some other text";
    puts(dmp.diff_main(text1, text2));//print the difference of the texts

(for more detailed documentation, as well as a complete overview of the API, please refer to the original [project site](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) ).
